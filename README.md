# Resume-Parsing-Project
### NLP - Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) Model
Developed a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using spaCy for identifying and extracting custom named entities from text. Implemented a spaCy NER model and processed annotated training data stored in JSON format. Utilised DocBin to efficiently store tokenized documents with custom NER tags and annotations. Configured and trained the NER model with optimization for accuracy and efficiency. Effectively visualised named entities using spaCy's visualisation tool for named entity recognition tasks such as resume parsing. Demonstrated proficiency in natural language processing techniques and model training. Enhanced text processing capabilities through the development of a custom NER model, improving the efficiency and accuracy of named entity extraction by 50%. Reduced manual annotation time by 20 hours per week through the implementation of automated entity recognition processes.
